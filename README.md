# LiftLogger
[You can follow my project notes live](https://mailuc-my.sharepoint.com/:o:/g/personal/woessnrw_mail_uc_edu/Ej6JKrPRPCNKvR1XEmHhwUIBwSf2vXG5rDgKGZ4oo6gPbA?e=GXJbws)
## Goal:
I can track my diet with a wide variety of applications, and it helps me remember what I ate and the amount I ate. This is useful because It lets me adjust my nutrition based on how I feel and the amount of calories I need for my workout. I cannot seem to track my exercises the same way, which is bad for trying to progress weight and still finish a full workout. Every app I tried has seemed to not plan for failure or allow me to customize my workouts.

## Functions:

This is a list of what I wish for the app to do

-   Track weight, reps and sets of a lift
-   Allow for me to add a failure option
-   Have an in-app calendar, so I can go back and review lifts from months prior
-   Every lift should have a notes option, so you can describe the lift if need be
-   Be able to add lifts, so you're not only tracking the typical Bench, Deadlift and Squat
-   Remember said added lifts and will add it to the users "available lifts"
-   Have a handy 1RM calculator handy
-   The ability to export lifts history in an Excel sheet

## Technical Skills Earned:
-  Django Rest API
-  React
-   React Native (Mobile App)
